<H2>Directions to Wabash College<br>
for the Wabash Modern Analysis Seminar</h2>
<p>
Crawfordsville, Indiana is located on US 231, Interstate 74, and Indiana 32,
about 50 miles west of Indianapolis.  
Coming in on I-74, get off at the US 231 exit (of the two Crawfordsville exits,
this is the one on the west) and proceed south; this becomes Washington Street.
<br>

<br>
Wabash College is located in Crawfordsville just west of Grant Street between
Wabash Avenue and Jefferson Street.  Grant Street is two blocks west of the main
north-south street in Crawfordsville, which is Washington Street.
<br>

<br>
Baxter Hall is most easily approached from the parking lot off the entrance on
the east side (i.e. the Grant Street side) of the college.  Baxter Hall is the
colonial style building with the modern addition at the southwest corner of the
parking lot.
