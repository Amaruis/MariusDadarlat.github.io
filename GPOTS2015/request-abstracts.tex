Dear Colleague,

I am writing to let you know that we posted the program of the talks.
We took into account your travel dates and hope that no time conflict will arise.

Andrew Toms will oversee the reimbursement process and all inquiries on this matter should be addressed to him, 
if you expect a reimbursement.

Please have a look at the file describing the documents that are needed for reimbursement before your trip.
Specific documents are required if you are not a US citizen.

Andrew and I are looking forward to see you at Purdue.

With best regards,

Marius
