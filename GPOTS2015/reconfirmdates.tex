REMINDER:

Dear Colleague,
You have registered for GPOTS 2015.
Please either reconfirm your participation online as indicated in my earlier message (reproduced below)
or advise me that you no longer plan to attend.
We need to finalize the reservations in student dorm tomorrow. 
I would appreciate a quick reply.
If I don't hear from you by Friday May 8 at 10am I would have to cancel your reservation.

Sincerely,

Marius Dadarlat

Dear Colleague,

I am writing to request that you reconfirm your participation and the dates of arrival and departure from West Lafayette.
It is very important that we have accurate dates in order to secure your reservation for a single room in the First Street Towers dorm (if you have requested so) and to schedule your contributed talk (if you have registered for such a talk).
We expect to be able to support the cost of lodging in student dorms for all junior participants (students and postdocs) and perhaps even for some of the other participants. To this purpose we really need accurate dates.

I would appreciate if you would reconfirm your participation (no later than May 6) using the form:

We are looking forward to see you at Purdue.

Sincerely,

Marius Dadarlat
