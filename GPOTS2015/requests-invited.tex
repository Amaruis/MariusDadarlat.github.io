Dear invited speaker,

I am writing to let you know that we posted the program of the talks.
We took into account your travel dates and hope that no time conflict will arise.

Andrew Toms will oversee the reimbursement process. It may be very helpful to have a look at the file describing the documents that are needed for reimbursement before your trip.

Andrew and I are looking forward to see you at Purdue.

With best regards,

Marius
